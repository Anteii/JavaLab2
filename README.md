## Data Domain
This repository contains Spring project for my second java practice. (Scheme is the same as <a href="https://github.com/Anteii/JavaLab1">In first practice</a>).
## Database
Same as <a href="https://github.com/Anteii/JavaLab1">In first practice</a>.
## Description
This practice contains Spring project configured with Spring Initialaizr (Spring web (MVC) + Hibernate + thymeleaf). This time in Model classes (in terms of MVC) I used not a DAO pattern but Repositrory.
Js files were changed and cleaned.
Hibernate and Spring properties locate in default application.properties.
Other things remain the same.
